# Console Virtual Pet 🐱

A simple, interactive C++ console application that simulates a virtual pet. This project demonstrates core programming concepts including game loops, state management, input handling, and a "pseudo-GUI" effect.

## 🎮 Features
*   **Dynamic Stats:** Manage Hunger, Happiness, and Energy.
*   **Visual Interface:** Uses ASCII art that changes based on the pet's mood (Happy, Sad, Sleepy).
*   **Game Loop:** Features a "tick" system where stats decay over time.
